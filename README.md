# Frida-AntiFingerprinting
Protect your privacy by breaking the fingerprint — spoof device details, stay anonymous.

Modern apps and trackers often build a unique device fingerprint using hardware and system properties like your CPU info, GPU vendor, build tags, IMEI, location, and more — creating a persistent identity that follows you across sessions and apps, even without traditional identifiers.

This project is a collection of frida scripts to spoof those details at runtime, helping you take control of your digital fingerprint and preserve your right to privacy.
